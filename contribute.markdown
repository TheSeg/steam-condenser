## How to contribute?

1. **Find bugs and report them**<br />
   Just use Steam Condenser and find bugs or other issues. Report them at the
   [issue tracker][1] and they *will* be fixed.
2. **Request new features**<br />
   Do you have a cool new idea that would fit well into Steam Condenser's
   functionality? Or do you have a nice little feature that would make Steam
   Condenser's features even better? Don't hesitate to propose them at the
   [issue tracker][1].
3. **Write patches**<br />
   Don't want to wait for bugs to be fixed and features to be added? Just start
   your own [fork][2] of Steam Condenser at [GitHub][3], make your own changes
   to the code and they will most likely find their way into the main
   library.
4. **Start an implementation for another language**<br />
   You think Steam Condenser is a great library? But you want to code in another
   language? Go on, start a Steam Condenser [fork][2] and develop your own Steam
   Condenser in any language you want, e.g. C++, Perl or Phyton.
5. **Donate**<br />
   Want to support Steam Condenser with money? Just click on the Pledgie button
   in the upper right and [donate][4] any amount you want. Each buck will be used for
   the project, e.g. an own web server. You can also use the Flattr button to support Steam Condenser. The amount donated via Flattr depends on your Flattr settings.
